GENERAL COMMENTS:

Your grade was determined by looking at the first two tests in each category.
I ran the third test to prove whether or not your code exhibits time complexity issues.
I encourage you to try to fix these issues on your own.

Must run without errors to receive a grade.
Must read from stdin and output to stdout.
Must be object oriented.
